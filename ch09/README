Marcus: I've modified the original and created a newer version:asm-linux-x86_64.c. This now compiles with no errors or warnings using gcc option -Wall 
. This required the c-library strtok call to be fixed so that it recognises unix \r\f line terminators. Correction to the char pointer type 
declarations so that function parameter type and function call parameter type matched were required. Some additional sundry initialiser formatting 
and return cleanup.
