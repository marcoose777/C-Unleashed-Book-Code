# C-Unleashed-Book-Code

Hopefully someone finds this useful, assuming someone is still reading this book in 2021
Apologies to Richard Heathfield, but if like me you don't have a CD-ROM then accessing the packaged code can
be troublesome.
Some examples don't compile with a current/recent GCC version, you will need to adjust the code yourselves accordingly
